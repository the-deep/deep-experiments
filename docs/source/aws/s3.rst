======

We use `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io>`_ to configure the AWS buckets.
We have the following one:

- ``sagemaker-deep-experiments-dev``, main development bucket
- ``sagemaker-deep-experiments-prod``, main production bucket
- ``deep-experiments-dvc-remote``, the remote bucket of DVC
- ``deep-documentation``, the bucket that hosts the documentation website
- ``deep-experiments-open-bucket``, an open bucket that can be used by the members of the team
- ``terraform-state-bucket-test-stefano``, the terraform state. We probably need to store it in a safest way
