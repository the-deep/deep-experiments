Testing Environment
===================

We have built a simple online test environment to check the predictions of our models on the subpillars.
You can find it `here <http://test-env.eba-crsiq2wb.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com>`_.

It is useful to show to externals our results. We plan to add more features to it.

We have used Streamlit as Python library, and Docker + ECR + Beanstalk as deployment option.
