In line with Government directives to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, humanitarian partners were required to reduce the scale of activities conducted in the camps and host communities. This reduced footprint seriously impacted the implementation of planned activities. Home gardening activities in the camp, which are season-dependent, were hampered and delayed due to such restrictions, also resulting in the suspension of operation of production centres. This left refugee volunteers without an income, while the level of self-reliance attained by livelihood programme participants has deteriorated.

Way Forward UNHCR continues to advocate with the Government to ensure continued humanitarian access to all areas and vital protection and assistance services, including refugee self-reliance activities. Meanwhile, UNHCR is in the process of developing a project to support adolescents and youths to develop skills required within the camps which is anticipated to start at the end of this year. For the remainder of 2021, depending on the COVID-19 situation, several events related to ongoing interventions are planned, including the organization of trainings in the camps.","['Agriculture', 'Cross', 'Livelihoods']",[],[],['Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)'],[],[],['Camp'],[],[],[],[],[],['Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)'],[],[],[],[],"['Affected', 'Displaced']",[],"['Capacities & Response->International Response', 'Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors', 'Impact->Impact On People', 'Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks']",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['Agriculture', 'Cross', 'Livelihoods']","['Capacities & Response->International Response', 'Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors', 'Impact->Impact On People', 'Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks']",[],[],[],[],['Camp'],[],[]

Vulnerable refugees including women, children, older persons and people living with disabilities particularly depend on these assistances, and protection interventions are often lifesaving for them.
