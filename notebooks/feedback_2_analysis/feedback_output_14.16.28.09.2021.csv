ae19902a-1cff-11ec-8ab7-0242ac110002,0.2.0,"Social Cohesion: Since 2019, UNHCR has continued to engage with the refugee and host communities to increase awareness on social cohesion and enhance peaceful coexistence, with over 5,000 individuals attending events during 2021.

In line with Government directives to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, humanitarian partners were required to reduce the scale of activities conducted in the camps and host communities. This reduced footprint seriously impacted the implementation of planned activities. Home gardening activities in the camp, which are season-dependent, were hampered and delayed due to such restrictions, also resulting in the suspension of operation of production centres. This left refugee volunteers without an income, while the level of self-reliance attained by livelihood programme participants has deteriorated.

Way Forward UNHCR continues to advocate with the Government to ensure continued humanitarian access to all areas and vital protection and assistance services, including refugee self-reliance activities. Meanwhile, UNHCR is in the process of developing a project to support adolescents and youths to develop skills required within the camps which is anticipated to start at the end of this year. For the remainder of 2021, depending on the COVID-19 situation, several events related to ongoing interventions are planned, including the organization of trainings in the camps.","{'missing': ['Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks', 'Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors', 'Capacities & Response->International Response', 'Impact->Impact On People'], 'text': '[Sector]:\n[2D]:\n[1D]:\n[Demographic]:\n[Specific]:\n[Affected]:\n[Severity]:\n[Geo]:\n', 'wrong': ['Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)', 'Affected', 'Displaced']}",entry,January - June 2021 Thematic Factsheet - Livelihood.pdf,s3://pdf-extracted-txt-files/2021-09-24/d9cb8f28-1cfc-11ec-b3ed-0242ac110002.txt,2021-09-24,Sapana Dangol,"Agriculture(0.67111), Cross(0.46233), Livelihoods(0.85405)",,,Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)(0.96069),,,Camp,"Agriculture(0.67111), Cross(0.46233), Education(0.01371), Food Security(0.11323), Health(0.04997), Livelihoods(0.85405), Logistics(0.02651), Nutrition(0.01022), Protection(0.12411), Shelter(0.04724), WASH(0.02449)","At Risk->Number Of People At Risk(0.00022), At Risk->Risk And Vulnerabilities(0.10295), Capacities & Response->International Response(0.28742), Capacities & Response->Local Response(0.00076), Capacities & Response->National Response(0.2068), Capacities & Response->Number Of People Reached/Response Gaps(0.08083), Humanitarian Conditions->Coping Mechanisms(0.02752), Humanitarian Conditions->Living Standards(0.22938), Humanitarian Conditions->Number Of People In Need(0.00183), Humanitarian Conditions->Physical And Mental Well Being(0.05493), Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors(0.33799), Impact->Impact On People(0.20314), Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks(0.29058), Impact->Number Of People Affected(0.02215), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00914), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Population(0.00024), Priority Needs->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00282), Priority Needs->Expressed By Population(0.00231)","Casualties->Dead(0.00356), Casualties->Injured(0.00123), Casualties->Missing(0.00018), Context->Demography(0.03212), Context->Economy(0.13678), Context->Environment(0.01), Context->Legal & Policy(0.02169), Context->Politics(0.02665), Context->Security & Stability(0.12686), Context->Socio Cultural(0.22955), Displacement->Intentions(0.00032), Displacement->Local integration(0.12814), Displacement->Pull factors(0.00137), Displacement->Push factors(0.02687), Displacement->Type/Numbers/Movements(0.01123), Humanitarian Access->Number of people facing humanitarian access constraints/Humanitarian access gaps(0.01039), Humanitarian Access->Physical constraints(0.05493), Information and Communication->Communication means and preferences(0.00141), Information and Communication->Information challenges and barriers(0.00156), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (hum)(5e-05), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (pop)(0.00136), Shock/Event->Hazard & Threats(0.00108), Shock/Event->Type and characteristics(0.00365)","Adult Female (18 to 59 years old)(0.0152), Adult Male (18 to 59 years old)(0.00322), Adult Unspecified gender (18-59 years old)(0.01042), Affected(0.0), Children/Youth Female (5 to 17 years old)(0.01247), Children/Youth Male (5 to 17 years old)(0.00613), Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)(0.96069), Infants/Toddlers (<5 years old)(0.05975), Older Persons Female (60+ years old)(0.00444), Older Persons Male (60+ years old)(0.00097), Older Persons Unspecified gender (60+ years old)(0.01626)","Child Head of Household(0.04074), Chronically Ill(0.19889), Elderly Head of Household(0.00452), Female Head of Household(0.04078), GBV survivors(0.03436), Indigenous people(0.13345), LGBTQI+(0.05314), Minorities(0.24806), Persons with Disability(0.132), Pregnant or Lactating Women(0.1099), Single Women (including Widows)(0.02964), Unaccompanied or Separated Children(0.19393)",

Throughout the camps, CHWs have reinforced community engagement activities through weekly visits to every household in the camps. This includes community- based surveillance; health education on hygiene promotion and prevention of AWD through house to house visits and small group sessions and active finding of cases with AWD and subsequent referrals to health facilities. Specific emphasis is being placed on “target camps”.

In 2020, a total of 28 RDT positive cases for Cholera were detected through sentinel testing, 5 of which were confirmed by culture – 2 from Ukhiya host community, 1 from Teknaf host community and 2 from the refugee camps. It is important to note that a Cholera outbreak occurred in late 2019 with a reported number of 239 RDT/ culture positive cases and in response a mass Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) vaccina- tion campaign was conducted with over 160 000 children of 1-<5 years being vac- Figure 12: Dehydration status of admitted cases reported cinated with a 2- doses regimen. from Leda DTC and other health facilities with isolation Since the onset of the outbreak in 2017, Diphtheria surveillance is ongoing in the camps.

Following the endorsement, this card will be initially piloted prior to further roll out.

The updated Health Facility Gap Analysis has been shared with health partners: this document helps the interested partners to plan for establishing new health facilities as per the need of respective camps. Currently, some organizations are going though transitions in pro- gramming and funding and a change in the landscape is expected in the coming weeks and months.

Worryingly, more than 1,800 of these cases were recorded since May 2021, representing over 70 percent of total cases reported since the pandemic began in March 2020.

The humanitarian community is extremely grateful to the Government of Bangladesh for the inclusion of the Rohingya refugees in the COVID-19 national vaccination plan.

Coli, though there were risks of contamination existed. But the E. Coli contamination varied with respect to stand points and household storage for each of the pipeline water supply system. The pH of was almost within the range of 6.5 - 8.5 Bangladesh standard.

Additionally, 96% of the Learning/ Multiple Centres are free from E. Coli contamination and matched WHO guideline value as well as Bangladesh standard. The reaming 1% and 3% have 1-10 cfu/100ml and 11-100 cfu/100ml E. Coli contamination respectively. The value of safe water in health care facilities, schools, workplaces and households is critical. The improvement of the quality of water is highly related to the lowering the incidence of water-borne disease outbreaks in world’s largest refugee camps.

To ensure transparency and responsibility in surveillance, WHO and UNICEF have trained the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) water sample collection teams – including Lab Analyzer, Sample Collector and Data Entry operator of DPHE– who are responsible for pre-selecting the points at the refugee camp, collect the water samples and physical tests to check pH or turbidity and bring DPHE water testing lab for the bio-chemical analyses.","{'missing': ['Capacities & Response->International Response'], 'text': '[Sector]:\n[2D]:\n[1D]:\n[Demographic]:\n[Specific]:\n[Affected]:\n[Severity]:\n[Geo]:\n', 'wrong': ['Geo: E.

e7bac26e-201e-11ec-9d41-0242ac110002,0.2.0,"Displacement within Myanmar substantially increased in the first half of September, following new violence and military operations. There are now approximately 208,000 people displaced within Myanmar due to conflict and unrest since 1 February 2021, an 18% increase over the previous two weeks. IDPs across the country continue to have extremely limited access to basic services, especially healthcare. Although COVID-19 positivity rates have declined and some related restrictions have been eased, the pandemic continues to place additional limitations on IDPs’ livelihoods as well as humanitarian access to them.

New displacement has taken place in Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions, as well as Kayah State, but may be short-term if IDPs are able to return to their places of origin once fighting subsides. In Kayah State, for example, the re-escalation of conflict in Demoso Township displaced over 21,000 people, but some 18,000 IDPs returned to their places of origin during the reporting period. Continuing armed clashes throughout Southeast Myanmar also displaced people in Tanintharyi Region, and Kayin State. In Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions, the newly displaced fled increased fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and both ethnic armed organizations and people’s defence forces, as well as the continued destruction of private property and desecration of religious sites.

Only health and other life-saving activities and distribution of core relief items and cooking fuel are allowed to be carried out; following advocacy by the international community, disaster risk response is also permitted. However, protection, including registration, gender-based violence prevention and response, child protection, and site management activities are not considered “critical” under the directive shared by the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) on 28 April. This has created gaps in in-person services such as mediation, legal counselling, community consultations, and case management which are normally conducted by trained protection actors. Vulnerable refugees including women, children, older persons and people living with disabilities particularly depend on these assistances, and protection interventions are often lifesaving for them. Currently these services are conducted remotely or with support of trained refugee volunteers. UNHCR continues to advocate for the inclusion of protection and site management as critical activities. Refugee and host community volunteers continue to play significant roles in the humanitarian response while access to the camps remains limited.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, Cox’s Bazar District experienced heavy monsoon rains and strong winds during the week of 27 July. The weather events resulted in the death of eight refugees and 15 Bangladeshis in the host community areas, as confirmed by government officials. 518 villages in Cox’s Bazar District are affected, while almost 25,000 refugees were displaced within the camps. A detailed report about UNHCR’s initial response to flooding and landslides can be found here.

Even with coordinated efforts to prepare the camps and refugees in advance of monsoon season throughout the year, this monsoon season had affected over 117,000 refugees due to soil erosion and flooding, wind and storms.","{'missing': ['Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks', 'Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors', 'Health', 'Food Security', 'Persons with Disability', 'Older Persons Unspecified gender (60+ years old)', 'Shock/Event->Hazard & Threats', 'Host'], 'text': '[Sector]:\n[2D]:\n[1D]:\n[Demographic]:\n[Specific]:\n[Affected]:\n[Severity]:\n[Geo]:\n', 'wrong': ['Geo: Refugee']}",entry,UNHCR Bangladesh_Operational Update_July 2021.pdf,s3://pdf-extracted-txt-files/2021-09-16/ce6223da-16b3-11ec-8afe-0242ac110002.txt,2021-09-16,Sapana Dangol,"Cross(0.69155), Protection(0.94637)","Capacities & Response->International Response(0.62837), Capacities & Response->National Response(0.43203)",Humanitarian Access->Physical constraints(0.53841),Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)(0.97115),,,"Bangladesh, Cox Bazar District, Refugee","Agriculture(0.01137), Cross(0.69155), Education(0.04431), Food Security(0.19837), Health(0.38178), Livelihoods(0.06623), Logistics(0.08605), Nutrition(0.01139), Protection(0.94637), Shelter(0.02018), WASH(0.04393)","At Risk->Number Of People At Risk(0.00011), At Risk->Risk And Vulnerabilities(0.22078), Capacities & Response->International Response(0.62837), Capacities & Response->Local Response(0.00042), Capacities & Response->National Response(0.43203), Capacities & Response->Number Of People Reached/Response Gaps(0.02445), Humanitarian Conditions->Coping Mechanisms(0.01642), Humanitarian Conditions->Living Standards(0.21683), Humanitarian Conditions->Number Of People In Need(0.00067), Humanitarian Conditions->Physical And Mental Well Being(0.13388), Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors(0.16411), Impact->Impact On People(0.0236), Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks(0.28242), Impact->Number Of People Affected(0.00528), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00734), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Population(0.00017), Priority Needs->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00023), Priority Needs->Expressed By Population(0.00091)","Casualties->Dead(0.00533), Casualties->Injured(0.0015), Casualties->Missing(0.00044), Context->Demography(0.20079), Context->Economy(0.01482), Context->Environment(0.00347), Context->Legal & Policy(0.02443), Context->Politics(0.01333), Context->Security & Stability(0.08772), Context->Socio Cultural(0.02133), Displacement->Intentions(0.00035), Displacement->Local integration(0.00808), Displacement->Pull factors(0.00025), Displacement->Push factors(0.00491), Displacement->Type/Numbers/Movements(0.04231), Humanitarian Access->Number of people facing humanitarian access constraints/Humanitarian access gaps(0.35062), Humanitarian Access->Physical constraints(0.53841), Information and Communication->Communication means and preferences(0.00039), Information and Communication->Information challenges and barriers(0.00084), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (hum)(9e-05), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (pop)(0.00648), Shock/Event->Hazard & Threats(0.00074), Shock/Event->Type and characteristics(0.00662)","Adult Female (18 to 59 years old)(0.55552), Adult Male (18 to 59 years old)(0.00458), Adult Unspecified gender (18-59 years old)(0.00358), Affected(0.0), Children/Youth Female (5 to 17 years old)(0.05869), Children/Youth Male (5 to 17 years old)(0.00718), Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)(0.97115), Infants/Toddlers (<5 years old)(0.01559), Older Persons Female (60+ years old)(0.31105), Older Persons Male (60+ years old)(0.0034), Older Persons Unspecified gender (60+ years old)(0.00673)","Child Head of Household(0.17767), Chronically Ill(0.15504), Elderly Head of Household(0.05331), Female Head of Household(0.13382), GBV survivors(0.44757), Indigenous people(0.08076), LGBTQI+(0.06709), Minorities(0.11862), Persons with Disability(0.37053), Pregnant or Lactating Women(0.1912), Single Women (including Widows)(0.20991), Unaccompanied or Separated Children(0.48881)",

An increase in the number of tests conducted among the Roh- ingya refugees was observed in weeks 33-34 as compared to weeks 31-32, from 2 546 to 2 493 tests. Among the host community an de- creased number was tested as well; from 8 107 tests in weeks 31-32 to 4 797 tests in week 33-34. Currently, 42 sample collection sites are operating for suspected COVID-19 patients.

WHO continues supporting the Government of Bangladesh through the Civil Surgeon’s office in the implementation of the COVID-19 Anti- gen Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) pilot testing in the Cox’s Bazar district. During the reporting period WHO conducted one session of hands- on training on “Use and analysis of COVID-19 Ag RDT at camp level” at MSF-OCA in Camp 2E to 5 healthcare workers.

To enhance preparedness for COVID-19 in Cox’s Bazar, WHO has been training healthcare workers on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) from Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) ITC partners and Government facilities. To date, training for IPC has been provided to 3600 humanitarian health care workers and government staff from healthcare facilities and SARI ITCs in Cox’s Bazar.

During the reporting period, the Infection Prevention and Control Technical Working Group (IPC TWG) and WHO IPC team conducted a technical assessment on IPC at CARE Bangladesh facility in Camp 4 Extension. This facility is expected to contribute on medical care for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recommendations for improvement in infrastructure, staff flow, and ventilation, among others, were

provided. In the coming days, further training will be provided by WHO IPC team.

Since the onset of the outbreak, WHO is coordinating regular weekly Operational, Clinical and Critical care online forums; each with a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections to foster peer to peer support and knowledge exchange. With the guidance provided by WHO experts, the initiative is serving as a foundation for optimized clinical care to ensure the best possible outcome for patients in Cox’s Bazar.","{'missing': ['Capacities & Response->International Response', 'Priority Interventions->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff'], 'text': '[Sector]:\n[2D]:\n[1D]:\n[Demographic]:\n[Specific]:\n[Affected]:\n[Severity]:\n[Geo]:\n', 'wrong': ['Geo: RDT', 'Geo: Operational', 'Geo: Clinical', 'Geo: Camp', 'Geo: 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital', 'Affected', 'Displaced', 'Non Displaced', 'Adult Unspecified gender (18-59 years old)', 'Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks']}",entry,WHO Cox's Bazar Situation Report #17.pdf,s3://pdf-extracted-txt-files/2021-09-21/087dd670-1ada-11ec-b93f-0242ac110002.txt,2021-09-21,Sapana Dangol,Health(0.98477),"Capacities & Response->National Response(0.55501), Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks(0.4646)",,Adult Unspecified gender (18-59 years old)(0.69777),,,"250 Bed District Sadar Hospital, Bandarban, Camp, Camp 2E, Chittagong, Clinical, Cox Bazar, Operational, RDT","Agriculture(0.00056), Cross(0.02008), Education(0.00331), Food Security(0.00191), Health(0.98477), Livelihoods(0.00348), Logistics(0.00743), Nutrition(0.00087), Protection(0.00325), Shelter(0.00047), WASH(0.00215)","At Risk->Number Of People At Risk(1e-05), At Risk->Risk And Vulnerabilities(0.00213), Capacities & Response->International Response(0.26132), Capacities & Response->Local Response(2e-05), Capacities & Response->National Response(0.55501), Capacities & Response->Number Of People Reached/Response Gaps(0.01539), Humanitarian Conditions->Coping Mechanisms(0.00123), Humanitarian Conditions->Living Standards(0.06269), Humanitarian Conditions->Number Of People In Need(0.00018), Humanitarian Conditions->Physical And Mental Well Being(0.0545), Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors(0.01276), Impact->Impact On People(0.00585), Impact->Impact On Systems, Services And Networks(0.4646), Impact->Number Of People Affected(0.00105), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00565), Priority Interventions->Expressed By Population(3e-05), Priority Needs->Expressed By Humanitarian Staff(0.00025), Priority Needs->Expressed By Population(0.00013)","Casualties->Dead(0.2752), Casualties->Injured(0.00696), Casualties->Missing(0.00086), Context->Demography(0.15971), Context->Economy(0.0118), Context->Environment(0.00585), Context->Legal & Policy(0.00442), Context->Politics(0.00834), Context->Security & Stability(0.15192), Context->Socio Cultural(0.01407), Displacement->Intentions(0.00088), Displacement->Local integration(0.01264), Displacement->Pull factors(0.00168), Displacement->Push factors(0.21737), Displacement->Type/Numbers/Movements(0.12702), Humanitarian Access->Number of people facing humanitarian access constraints/Humanitarian access gaps(0.00134), Humanitarian Access->Physical constraints(0.01671), Information and Communication->Communication means and preferences(0.00022), Information and Communication->Information challenges and barriers(0.00015), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (hum)(8e-05), Information and Communication->Knowledge and info gaps (pop)(0.00048), Shock/Event->Hazard & Threats(0.00092), Shock/Event->Type and characteristics(0.00232)","Adult Female (18 to 59 years old)(0.04755), Adult Male (18 to 59 years old)(0.04051), Adult Unspecified gender (18-59 years old)(0.69777), Affected(0.0), Children/Youth Female (5 to 17 years old)(0.00851), Children/Youth Male (5 to 17 years old)(0.00446), Children/Youth Unspecified gender (5 to 17 years old)(0.4192), Infants/Toddlers (<5 years old)(0.21287), Older Persons Female (60+ years old)(0.00221), Older Persons Male (60+ years old)(0.00047), Older Persons Unspecified gender (60+ years old)(0.10974)","Child Head of Household(0.01185), Chronically Ill(0.05914), Elderly Head of Household(0.00127), Female Head of Household(0.01426), GBV survivors(0.04059), Indigenous people(0.19948), LGBTQI+(0.02467), Minorities(0.19946), Persons with Disability(0.05004), Pregnant or Lactating Women(0.14832), Single Women (including Widows)(0.00873), Unaccompanied or Separated Children(0.05384)",
