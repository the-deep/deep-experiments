"In Southeast Myanmar, UNHCR and the Myanmar Red Cross Society commenced a rapid protection assessment of IDPs in Tanintharyi Region. In Kayin State, UNHCR delivered 709 mosquito nets to IDP and host communities. In Kachin State, UNHCR is increasing its support to civil society and faith-based organizations in their response to COVID-19. UNHCR has provided beds, mattresses, and washing machines to a community treatment centre, as well as NFIs for isolation spaces inside IDP camps. UNHCR plans to provide additional essential hygiene items to support its local partners’ response. In central Rakhine, humanitarian activities have resumed. In the first two weeks of September, UNHCR delivered shelter assistance to 352 households in Sittwe-area camps for Rohingya IDPs, and sanitary kits to 2,704 women and girls in displacement sites in Mrauk, Kyauktaw, and Minbya. In northern Rakhine, UNHCR and UNDP’s quick impact projects (QIPs) on pond construction have progressed, benefiting from the involvement of communities who have provided technical guidance.","['Cross', 'WASH']",['Capacities & Response->International Response'],[],[],"['Affected', 'Displaced', 'IDP', 'Non Displaced']",[],[]

IDPs across the country continue to have extremely limited access to basic services, especially healthcare. Although COVID-19 positivity rates have declined and some related restrictions have been eased, the pandemic continues to place additional limitations on IDPs’ livelihoods as well as humanitarian access to them.

New displacement has taken place in Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions, as well as Kayah State, but may be short-term if IDPs are able to return to their places of origin once fighting subsides. In Kayah State, for example, the re-escalation of conflict in Demoso Township displaced over 21,000 people, but some 18,000 IDPs returned to their places of origin during the reporting period. Continuing armed clashes throughout Southeast Myanmar also displaced people in Tanintharyi Region, and Kayin State. In Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions, the newly displaced fled increased fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and both ethnic armed organizations and people’s defence forces, as well as the continued destruction of private property and desecration of religious sites. In Kachin State, continuing clashes between the MAF and Kachin Independence Army additionally displaced several hundred people in Waingmaw and Putao townships.","['Cross', 'Health']",['Impact->Driver/Aggravating Factors'],[],[],"['Affected', 'Displaced', 'IDP']",[],[]

However, protection, including registration, gender-based violence prevention and response, child protection, and site management activities are not considered “critical” under the directive shared by the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) on 28 April. This has created gaps in in-person services such as mediation, legal counselling, community consultations, and case management which are normally conducted by trained protection actors. Vulnerable refugees including women, children, older persons and people living with disabilities particularly depend on these assistances, and protection interventions are often lifesaving for them. Currently these services are conducted remotely or with support of trained refugee volunteers. UNHCR continues to advocate for the inclusion of protection and site management as critical activities.
