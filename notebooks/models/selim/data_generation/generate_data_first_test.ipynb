      "Furthermore, key informants in all municipalities reported that residents were negatively affected. The Negative Impact On Residents Ranged From Difficulties Faced In Accessing Work And Livelihood Opportunities.\n",
      "Ultimately, the lack of liquidity to buy necessary inputs, including medicine, fodder and live animals were mentioned as the main problems affecting livestock production. The Lack Of Liquidity To Buy Necessary Inputs, Including Medicine, Fodder And Live Animals Was Experienced By Most Livestock Herders Prior To The Crisis Of 2011 Up Until Today.\n",

      "Aditionally, a third of migrants are classified as food insecure (32%) according to food Consumption Scores and the Livelihood Strategies indicators. An Additional Third Are Considered Marginally Food Insecure (34%) And At Risk Of Food Insecurity.\n",
      "Besides, most IDP families are staying with host families and in rented accommodations. Food, Shelter, Health, Non-Food Items And Wash Are The Most Identified Needs.\n",

Heavy Clashes Also Saw Closures Of Four Hospitals In Sabratha And Surman That Were Providing An Average Of 18,000 Medical Consultations Per Week.\n",

      "Besides, between 1,500 and 2,000 cases of acute diarrhoea are reported each week. The Possibility Of A Cholera Outbreak Remains High54.\n",
      "Ultimately, shortages and 150% price increases for all staple food commodities. Health Centres Are Reportedly Struggling To Obtain These Items. Shortages And Price Spikes Are Expected To Continue And Worsen With The Ongoing Road Closures.\n",

      "Moreover, six civilian casualties were reported in the first quarter of 2020. the remaining seven civilian casualties were from ground fighting.\n",
      "Aditionally, more than 149,000 people have been forced to leave their home since the beginning of the conflict in April 2019. 749,000 People Are Estimated To Be In Areas Affected By Clashes. The Sustained Use Of Air Strikes And Artillery Shelling Continues To Negatively Impact The Safety And Lives Of The Civilian Population In Southern Tripoli Region.\n",
      "Finally, 7 out of 24 assessed municipalities migrants were reported to be unable to move freely within the municipality due to restrictions on freedom of movement as public health measures. 54% Of Migrants Were Reported To Be Unable To Leave Or Arrive At These Municipalities Due To Restrictions On Movement Imposed.
